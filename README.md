# To-Do, Doing, Done List

It is an open web application where users can create "To Do Lists" whether it is Personal, Work, or anything else. They can add tasks or items to the "to-do list." Each task/item has three stages: to-do, doing and done. The user can organize them by moving indiviual task/item from the to-do stage to the doing and then to the done stage.
